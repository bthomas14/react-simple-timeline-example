* How long you spent on the assignment.
This project took me about 5 hours in total.

* What you like about your implementation.
I like that by grouping items by line based on looking at the latest end date in the group,
the program efficiently finds where to place rows.
I decided not to show the graph lines, and I like the cleaner look of this.

* What you would change if you were going to do it again.
The nested for loop in here is not my favorite, though it's at least looping over a condensed set,
as opposed to the total data set. I at first tried implementing a binary tree to organize the data instead but realized it wouldn't quite fit the need and decided on a simpler course.
Also, I don't like how the form field looks/acts, especially for very short timeline items, and would keep tweaking that if I had more time.

* How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
I dithered over a few ways to organize the timeline items, and decided that the simplest thing would be to create a data structure that somewhat mirrors how I want the items organized on the page.
I didn't look at other timeline plugins.
I took the basic visual design from a image I found on Dribbble.

* How you would test this if you had more time.
Larger data set to see how nested for loop performs. Also, items spanning longer time period - this would need a solution but I felt this was outside the scope of the project.
